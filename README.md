# ECEN5013-HW3 EXTRA CREDIT BRANCH
Forking, Cloning, Threads, and Multi-Threading

Don't really look at this one, it does some aspects of the extra credit correctly:

it does use a hashmap, keep a count of words on SIGUSR2, but it's much less stable than master, doesn't keep a running count of top words, and doesn't use a very good hashmap.
